# Frontend Guideline Document

## 1. Frontend Architecture

**Overview**

*   Once the system is up, we use MISP’s built-in web interface rather than building a separate UI from scratch.
*   Before system startup, the UI is primarily terminal commands and menu-driven scripts.

## 2. Design Principles

**Usability**

*   Predictable page structure: header, navigation, content area, footer.
*   Clear labels on buttons and menus; consistent placement of actions.

**Accessibility**

*   Keyboard-friendly navigation and form controls with proper labels.

**Responsiveness**

*   Bootstrap’s grid and utility classes ensure layouts adapt to desktop, tablet, and terminal setups without extra effort.

**Application of Principles**

*   Every new view uses the same layout wrapper and element calls.

## 3. Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

This project builds on MISP’s mature, server-rendered UI, leveraging CakePHP and Bootstrap, to deliver a consistent, accessible, and performant primary user interface.

The terminal user interface can be via straight text and command line driven, although a fully encapsulated menu-driven tool for setup, monitoring, and management of the system is the end state
